V1: non motorized, not moving
https://sendcutsend.com/guidelines/bending/

- Height is 10 in from ground when BIOBOT is at lowest position
- 6 in down from bottom
- 5 into 


## Vertex Improved Step for Accessibility (VISA)

- 6527K614 McMaster for initial into trailer hitch
- Comes out into a platform for another step, triangle supports out to it 
	- (6x6? 6x5?)
- Member coming straight down (~6 in down, 10in off ground from resting position)
	- Need to measure off of new 0 position in ROS2 version
- Comes out to another step, with again a triangle support off of the vertical member






1. Make a non-motorized version, welded, with holes to mount a motor and reasonable upgradability
2. CAD a motorized version and put it in the SSL CAD database

*maybe*
3. Make motorized version
	1. Would be good to interface with VERTEX code and electronics wise
	2. Could be a joint project with some other code freshman, like the one Rahul is grooming

Motorization:

- If I can turn off brake mode on this motor, I could just get it up to vertical then turn off brake, let it fall
- Three buttons, Up, down, "E-stop" which just turns off power and brake mode

Timeline:
