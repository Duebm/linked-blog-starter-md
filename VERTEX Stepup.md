Motorization:

- If I can turn off brake mode on this motor, I could just get it up to vertical then turn off brake, let it fall
- Three buttons, Up, down, "E-stop" which just turns off power and brake mode

[[Linear actuators, Triangles]]:

- Charlie will put me in contact with someone who can explain how the joints on ARMLESS use linear actuators and triangles.
