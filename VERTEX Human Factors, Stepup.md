[[Active projects, Compiled Timelines]]

1. Make a non-motorized version, welded, with holes to mount a motor and reasonable upgradability
2. CAD a motorized version and put it in the SSL CAD database

*maybe*
3. Make motorized version
	1. Would be good to interface with VERTEX code and electronics wise
	2. Could be a joint project with some other code freshman, like the one Rahul is grooming

Motorization:

- If I can turn off brake mode on this motor, I could just get it up to vertical then turn off brake, let it fall
- Three buttons, Up, down, "E-stop" which just turns off power and brake mode
