**Integrating Factor (M)** - 
Used for solving first order [[ODE]]s 
1. Isolate the constant in the equation 
2. Multiply the ODE by M
	- (dy/dt) (M) + (M)(yt^2)
- M= e^intyt2
	- In this example it is (yt^2) b/c that is the rest of the equation

**Euler's Method

- Used when not separable 
- General form for Euler's exactness test: dy/dx = M(x,y)/ N(x,y)
